//! Windows API helpers and constants
//!
//! Note: Most Windows API access is done via the `windows` crate directly.
//! This module contains any additional helpers or constants not covered.

// Currently empty - the `windows` crate provides excellent coverage.
// This file exists for any custom helpers we might need later.
